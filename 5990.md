## Lecture 1 Professional and practice 
###### definition: profession is a paid occupation, especially one that involves prolonged training and formal qualification.

- Expertise =	knowledge (knowing about something, how to do it) + 

skills (being able to do it - competence, capability)

- Qualifications and certification
- Knowledge and skill standards
- Common body of knowledge
- Ethical standards
###### Practice is the actual application or use of an idea, belief, or method, as opposed to theories relating to it.是一种想法、信念或方法的实际应用或使用，而不是与之相关的理论。
###### Professionalism is the ability to do what you are supposed to do and not do what you are not supposed to be doing; It is about how the things you say, how you act and how you dress. It is also about your character.
### Professional Practice Why? and what is it?
###### Why: 

- IT is a major investment for many organisations and is critical for creating value
- So doing IT well matters to organizations
- Professional Practice helps you do it well by providing you with skills and knowledge to enhance your technical skills in an organisational context.专业实践通过为您提供技能和知识，帮助您在组织环境中提高技术技能，从而做好专业实践工作
### The IT Industry

##### Role of IT

- IT is an organisational environment can be used for: ![11871708433319_.pic.jpg](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2024/jpeg/21505091/1708433343056-341f1984-e0c6-4b32-a98e-1552b18997d2.jpeg#averageHue=%23e6e6e6&clientId=ub6bd3f82-a6c3-4&from=drop&id=uc7e9d5a2&originHeight=280&originWidth=1258&originalType=binary&ratio=2&rotation=0&showTitle=false&size=97381&status=done&style=none&taskId=u00489923-3614-479a-b43b-2dac89e601a&title=)
- I**T provides value to an organisation** through changing the way in which business functions and processes are carried out and providing new functions and enabling new business models IT通过改变执行业务功能和流程的方式，以及提供新功能和启用新业务模型，为组织提供价值
##### Diversity in High Tech 

- Why?
   - it helps create a stronger and broader narrative about the case for diversity创建一个更强大广阔的样例让更多人获得认同感
   - Accurately reflects an individual's intersectional complexity instated of focusing on only one 准确反映个体的交叉复杂性
   - Demographic equality -rather than being its own end人口平等 而不是其本身的目的 应视为实现更广阔目标的手段 而非独立的目标
   - lack of diversity has led to under-utilization of available talent and under recruitment of potentially valuable employees缺乏多样性会导致人才利用率不足
- High Tech: Evaluation of the industry
   - employement of women and non-white workers in these occupations, accompanied by a steady exodus of these same workers, particularly women, from tech job. 妇女和非白人员工的就业率不断下降，妇女不断从技术行业消失
- High Tech Geography: Dispersing
   - moved from a niche economic product dependent on highly specialized expertise to become a major source of economic vitality从依赖高度专业化技术的小众经济产品转变为经济活力的主要来源。
- Labor Diversity: Supply vs. Demand
- Exiting Tech & Related Field
   - Research by The Center for Work-Life Policy shows that 41 percent of qualified scientists, engineers, and technologists are women at the lower rungs of corporate ladders but more than half quit their jobs.
## Lecture2

- an organisation and its IT as inherently intertwined 一个组织和他的IT本质上是交织在一起的
- a value stream as a collection of capabilities such as business processes, skills, technology, that creates value by delivering a product, service or experience to a stakeholder 价值流是业务流程，能力，技术等一系列能力的集合，用以创造产品，价值或服务以提供给利益相关者
- IT capabilities of an organisation as a rich mosaic of elements that can be configured and re-configured to create value streams through cross-functional teams 例如 IT applications, IT project, database service
- value creation activities managed by tools such as project management, develops, service management由项目管理，开发，服务管理等工具管理的价值创造活动
### Foundamental Concepts
###### Organisations
**An organisation is a structured group of people, with a particular purpose (goal), to create some kinds of value for its stakeholders**
an organisation can be a business goal is to create value in the form of profits through commercial activities, or it can be a government department or a non-profit organisation whose goal is to create value in the form of improved health outcomes for its citizens
Stakehodlers can include e.g. customers, clients, suppliers供应商, shareholders股东 投资者, employees, communities, citizens
an organisation will have objectives and strategies to realise their goals
###### clarifying between Organisation and Business
Organisation is out preferred term, which inlcudes both commercial and non-commercial organisations (also, enterprise is a similar term)
As professionals, we should consider the application of IT in all forms of human endeavour, not just commercial ones. Although the emphasis in much of the IT world is on profit-making services, theres an increasing important tools for e.g. supporting and improving social services
Business is a frequently used term in sources that you will access, and where a term is very commonly used - such as 'business model', or 'business strategy' we have retained that term to include non-commercial organisations
###### Organisational Structures vary
it can be structured in many ways, like top-down hierarchical structure (traditional bank, or an army) or a networked structure (ride-sharing organisation, or e-commerce market place)
The structure generally reflects the way in which roles and responsibilities, lines of communications and allocation of resources

- In top-down organisation, its structure has been broken down into its various functions with a hierarchical approach to responsibilities and communication flows 它的结构被分解成不同的功能，职责和沟通流程按层次划分![12111709085620_.pic.jpg](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2024/jpeg/21505091/1709085640173-ce4768af-4d6f-427b-a75b-47deb61851e6.jpeg#averageHue=%23f0eceb&clientId=u19d88359-1384-4&from=drop&id=u3509b1df&originHeight=926&originWidth=1596&originalType=binary&ratio=2&rotation=0&showTitle=false&size=185698&status=done&style=none&taskId=uf329bfb9-3eb1-47a8-ac8b-17771a4fd04&title=)
- a network structured organisation, organizes contractors and third-party vendors to carry out certain key functions, facilitated by IT. It features a relatively small headquarters with geographically-dospersed satellite offices, along with key functions outsourced to other firms and consultants 组织承包商和第三方运营商在IT的助力下执行某些关键内容。特征是相对较小的总部和卫星分布的办事处，重要职能外包给其他公司和顾问
   - Alibaba: the platform is a networked organisation which facilitates exchanges amongst multiple people or organisations as both vendors or consumers
   - Alibaba is not a retailer in the traditional sense. It does not source or keep stock, and logistics services are carried out by third-party providers
###### Value & Organisational Value
Value is the importance, worth, or usefulness of something as perceived by a person, or a group of people.
In organisations, it typically refers to what is important or useful to the stakeholders of the organisation, e.g.  shareholders, employees, customers, citizens, communities

- Why do customers or clients purchase goods or services?
   - based on perceived感受到的 value
- Why do venture capitalists invest in certain startups?
   - commercial investors hope for value in the form of long-term profit from their invetment
- Why do governments or non-profit organisations invest (time or money) in certain ventures？
   - exployees or volunteers exchange their services for financial or personlal value by working at an organisation
- Why do employees, or colunteers, choose to work at one organisation over another?
   - government of non-profits hope for value in the form of social equity or national interests such as health
- ⬆️ The answer of these questions boils down to an essential organisational objective - value creation

Value is fundamental to everything that an organisation does.
The primary reason that an organisation exists is to provide value, at an optimum level of return, to its stakeholders
###### IT investment  
**Distincetion between resources and capabilities**

- Resources refer to what an organisation owns. They might be :
   - tangible有形的 - such as property, machinery or hardware
   - intangible无形的 - such as the knowledge and skills of employees, policies, procedures, processes, software
- Capabilities refer to what the organisation can do by using those resources
   - A capability is the ability to execute a specified course of action to achieve outcomes based on the resources available such as skills and technolgy. **根据可用的资源(如技能和技术)执行指定的行动过程以实现结果的能力。**
- **e.g. **
   - Tangible resources - a. network quipment
   - Intangible resources - a. network engineer's skills - b. software - c. processes that guide the course of action to produce the outcome
   - Capability = ability to execute 2a + 3a + 3b + 3c -> 1

**What is an IT investment**

- Money an organisation spends on IT-related resources and capabilities that enable an organisation to create value, which can include: hardware, software, data, people, processes and frameworks
- These resources and capabilities can be internally owned by the organisation or externally sourced (like XaaS)
### How is that organisational value created?
#### organisational(business) goals
Organisational goals define an endpoint, accomplishment or targets an organisation wants to achieve i.e. organisational value
It help to:

- **set the direction of an organisation**
- **measure progress**
- **establish accountability**
- **improve decision-making**
##### Why are business goals important

- **It helps measure progress. **Business goals provide the milestones that can help an organization measure its success of lack thereof.
- **It set the direction of a company. **Business goals allow all employees to have a clear idea of where the company wants to go and what it wants to be.
- **It establish accountability. **Business goals enable management to take ownership of its successes or failures.
- **It improve decision-making. **It align the activities of the business so management can constantly evaluate decisions to ensure the business moves toward its target.
##### Organisational Objectives & Strategy

- **Objectives** specify the methods, path and metrics that can help an organisation achieve a goal
   - reduce expenses by 5%, increase sales by 5% etc.
- **Business goals vs business objectives **
   - Business goals and business objectives are closely related, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.
   - Organisational objectives specify the methods, paths, and metrics that can help an organisation achieve a goal.
   - Business goals represent the direction in which a company intends to go and define what the organization wants to achieve.  代表了公司打算走的方向，并定义了组织想要实现的目标  business objective specifies the mothods and paths that can help a business achieve that goal 指定可以帮助企业实现该目标的方法和路径
   - Strategy is a plan to achieve the goals and objectives of an organisation 例如 审查成本以减少开支
#### Business models, business operating models and business capabilities
A business model is a description of how an organisation creates, delivers and captures value
The model is not only used to describe commercial organisations, but also government and non-profit organisations, where the value being created is not necessarily financial, which is based on the business strategy
formal structure:

- Customers/clients/users 谁是我们的客户，他们的需求是什么，是否有什么普遍的需求
- the value proposition - what needs will our offering meet. 产品能满足什么需求
- a financial model 怎么赚钱？要投资多少才能赚钱
- capabilities 需要哪些组织内外的能力

Most organisations will have more than one business model targeted at different customers. 
##### An operating model executes the business model

- An operating model is the blueprint for how value will be created and delivered to stakeholders 运营模式是 如何创造价值并将其蓝图传递给利益相关者
- It details how an organisation configures and re-configure its capabilities to create and deliver value to the organisation to achieve its goals and strategic objectives 说明了组织如何配置和重新配置其能力，从而为组织创造和交付价值，以实现其目标和战略目标
- An operating model also defines how the organisation manages itself and it resources through its management processes, governmance and culture运营模式还定义了组织如何通过其管理流程、治理和文化来管理自身及其资源
- Any change to the organisation's business models will require changes to the operating model 任何对商业模式进行的改变都需要对运营模式进行改变
##### General benefits of an operating model

- **Effectiveness效能 **- effort and spend are focused on what is important for the organisation - e.g. aligns the IT investment with organisational goals
- **Efficiency效率** - execution is optimised - i.e. to get the best possible result at the least cost
- **Risk Management风险管理 **- optimised management of risk
- **Optimised performance优化性能 **- cost efficiency and agile
#### IT strategy, IT operating model, and IT capabilities
IT strategy is part of organisational strategy. It is a plan for how the organisations IT investments will be applied across the organisation to achieve the **organisational goals and objectives **
It is **NOT** the plan to achieve operational objectives internal to IT such as costs, service levels performance
Measures of success of the IT startegy are linked to organisational goals and objectives衡量IT策略成功与否的标准与组织目标有关
##### IT operating model
It details how an organisation configures and re-configures its IT capabilities to deliver value to the organisation to achieve its goals and strategic objectives, which spans the whole IT lifecycle. 说明组织如何配置和重新配置其IT能力，以向组织交付价值，以实现其目标和战略目标
It defines:

- The scope and role of IT resources and capabilities IT资源和功能的范围和角色
- How IT work is performed, where and by whom 如何执行IT工作，在哪里以及由某人
- How the IT investment is managed and optimised 如何管理及优化IT投资
- How IT is governed to ensure it remains aligned to the IT strategy and in turn to the organisational strategy through IT Governance 如何治理IT以确保它与IT策略一致，并通过IT策略与组织策略保持一致
- How IT investments are assessed, budgeted, reviewed and approved 如何评估，预算，审查和批准IT投资
- The organisational structure and processes by which the above is performed 执行上述工作的组织结构和构成
- how IT capabilties are structured, managed and aligned with organisation startegy , through the IT operating model 透过资讯科技运作模式，如何建构、管理资讯科技能力，并使其与组织策略保持一致

##### General benefits of an IT operating model

- Effectiveness - effort and investment are focused on what is important for the enterprise (IT/business alignment) IT/业务一致性
- Efficiency - execution is optimised (minimal waste) 最小化损耗
- Effective Risk Management - optimised management of risk 优化风险管理
- Optimised performance - cost effective and agile
##### IT capabilities
It refers to what can be done by using the organisations IT resources to execute a specific course of action to achieve a certain outcome. 通过使用组织的It资源来执行特定的行动过程以实现特定的结果可以做什么。
The operating model governs how it capability are structured, managed and aligned with organisational strategy.

#### Orchestrating Business and IT capability into value stream
A value stream takes an end-to-end perspective of value creation from the stakeholder's point of view
To create value for the stakeholder, a series of value-adding business and IT capabilities is configured
Value streams may be defined at any level of an organisation. The complete set of values streams in an organisation is an aggregation of the multiple ways in which the organisation creates values for its various stakeholders价值流可以在组织的任何层次上定义。组织中完整的价值流集合是组织为其各种利益相关者创造价值的多种方式的集合
The value stream represents how IT is embedded with other organisational capabilities in the creation value 价值流表示IT如何在创造价值中嵌入其他组织能力

**Example of value Stream description and decomposition**

1. Identify the value stream and describe it on 4 standard elements. The first element names the desired customer activity![12151709092594_.pic.jpg](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2024/jpeg/21505091/1709092622435-1e4106e2-f29f-40cd-9915-10dfdfcf0808.jpeg#averageHue=%23eaaca2&clientId=u0c160085-d356-4&from=drop&id=uf268d95c&originHeight=151&originWidth=691&originalType=binary&ratio=2&rotation=0&showTitle=false&size=40111&status=done&style=none&taskId=ucd0db672-9d15-4dc3-8e9d-52eb228f37c&title=)
2. Decompose Acquire Retail Product into a sequence of value-creating stages![12161709092602_.pic.jpg](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2024/jpeg/21505091/1709092627001-abab98d1-dbdc-4809-aa01-a86d70787054.jpeg#averageHue=%23ec7463&clientId=u0c160085-d356-4&from=drop&id=u1647257b&originHeight=61&originWidth=670&originalType=binary&ratio=2&rotation=0&showTitle=false&size=23423&status=done&style=none&taskId=u313fc4f9-67b6-4a45-9461-f6d496a71cb&title=)
3. Describe each decomposed stage, as in the example below
4. Identify which capabilities are needed to enable the stage, and map them the stage![12171709092615_.pic.jpg](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2024/jpeg/21505091/1709092634200-f62a1479-b1c4-497f-ba0d-6d1f7c00bcfb.jpeg#averageHue=%23eecfb2&clientId=u0c160085-d356-4&from=drop&id=ubaf2dc55&originHeight=352&originWidth=708&originalType=binary&ratio=2&rotation=0&showTitle=false&size=79873&status=done&style=none&taskId=u118b1aab-b52c-4176-8cc8-f203894c3d5&title=)
### How to represent IT value as Organisational Value
the organisational value of IT investment is measured by its impact on organisational goals and objectives
### What does this mean for you as an IT professional

## Lecture3 Project Characteristics
##### What is a project:

- a temporary endeavour undertaken to create a unique result (a set of functions) 为创造一个独立的结果而进行的 临时性的努力
- managed by project management techniques 通过项目管理技术进行管理
- Can be for in-house development or outsourced development 可以是内部开发 也可以是外包
##### Project characteristics:

- Accomplishment with shared resources often only available on a part-time basis
- cross-functional teamwork maybe required 
- Uncertainty and potential change during execution
- changes to the way the business operates
- specific deadlines, time and resource constraints
###### result of a project being completed

- the continuous delivery of those functions to users from the IT infrastructure owned or controlled by the university
- managed by techniques such as IT service management (ISTM) & DevOps
   - In the context of the organisation's strategies for creating value
   - subject to continuous omprovement processes
### Interdependence and integration
An organisation's IT-related resources (i.e. hardware, software, people & processes) consist of multiple interdependent system entities, crossing multiple technical and human boundaries, which must perate in a unified way (therefore, each entities are depending on each other)
#### Building or acquiring a new system to integrate into the organisation

1. Before project initiation -strategic plaaning for:
   - value
   - costs
   - risks, etc.
2. During the project
   - system requirements
   - integration requirements
   - design
   - build or acquire
   - customise
   - test
   - process redesign
   - training
3. Integration into the live environment
#### Running an integrated system

1. operation in the live environment:
   - manage incidents and problems
   - report status and projections for continuity and risk
   - manage service levels
   - integrate upgrades
   - ensure integration with future new systems
2. At all stages: continuous feedback and improvement to align with organisational goals

### Benefits and challenges of the iterative process
Pros:

- Increased efficiency
- increased collaboration
- increased adaptability
- More cost effecttive
- Ability to work in parallel
- Reduced project-level risk
- More reliable user feedback

Cons:

- Increased risk of scope creep
- Infexible planing and requirements
- Vague timelines
### IT Lifecycle
Definition: The IT lifecycle is the series of stages which an IT capability goes through from its inception to its retirement from use
### From linear to continuous IT lifecycles
#### Business and IT silos
In traditional development, the development team and operations team worked in silos
Development teams focus on functionality, features and non-functional requirements
The focus of operations teams were cost, reliability, security, risk and manageability
#### A traditional, linear approach to the lifecycle for an IT capability
Traditionally, the approach to managing the lifecycle of a software application was a set of linear, sequential, stages that managed the development of the application as a project
The waterfall method was typically used for this project management and was an earlier foundation of the PMBOK (Project management body of knowledge) and SDLC (Software development life cycle) methodologies
银行系统的IT开发是由架构和基础设施审查委员会监督的，这导致了大量的文档和长开发时间
同时，受安全考量，开发过程中面临大量测试组并由管理机构签署代码
这些举措是用来维护银行系统，使其免受返工并考虑安全问题，但是 这也导致在出现问题时修复错误的时间较长
due to:

- IT is increasingly inextricably interwined with all aspects of an organisation rather than provided as a hands-off service to business
- Th IT lifecycle is iterative and continuous over time

Some other methods are also emerge (though the waterfall methods is still appropriate for many situations
### Enterprise architecture and its role in the continuous IT lifecycle
#### Factors in this shift

- Increased technological capacity and speed (hardware), and new capabilities (e.g. virualisation and AI) -> increase not just speed of operation but speed of development as well
- The increased sophistication and automation of enterprise architecture as a reliable repository of information about components, relationships among them, and principles guiding their develoment and use
- The development of IT service management (ITSM) processes that align all aspects of development, operation, and use of IT with a business - from strategy to continuous improvement (e.g. ITIL)

- Agile approaches - iterative, small scale, incremental, coolaborative, and cross-functional teams
- DevOps - the integration of development and testing, continuous, releases and cross-functional teams
- Value stream approaches - customer-focused orchestration of business and IT capabilities to create a value stream usign cross-functional teams
#### Current approaches to the IT lifecycle
Current approaches to the lifecycle of an IT capability such as a software application treat it as a continuous cycle of processes that:

- Are initiated by e.g. a customer need,
- Or, are initiated by an organisational need to:
   - drive growth
   - deliver cost savings
   - reduce risk
- Are aligned with the organisation's goals, strategies and governance
- integrate both business and IT capabilities
- are response to rapid change
- deliver measureable business value
#### IT services management (ITSM) frameworks
#### The agile approach
#### DevOps
#### Elements of a continuous IT lifecycle

1. Planning the development (aligned with business strategy)
2. Establishing requirements, designing, building (or acquiring), testing
3. Deploying to the live environment (integrating with other e.g. other applications, middleware, operating systems), maintaining service levels (e.g. troubleshooting) and measuring performance
4. Monitoring the value to the organisation. Depending on the resultsof the monitoring a new planning process would begin for refinements and improvements, making the cycle continuous (the cycle time can be long/short)
5. in the way, the continuous IT lifecycle embodies all the elements of Continuous Improvement
### Some Frameworks and approaches for managing the continuous IT lifecycle
This idea of a continuous IT lifecycle is reflected in frameworks and approaches such as IT service management (ITSM), agile, and DevOps

- The criticla enableers of the success of these frameworks are the technological advances
### Enterprise Architecture and its Role in the Continuous IT Lifecycle
### Enterprise Architecture

- Enterprise architecture is a way of **addressing complexity and change on a large scale 企业架构是处理大规模复杂性和变化的一种方式**
- it is a set of descriptive representations of:
   - The structure of components
   - The inter-dependence of their relationships
   - The principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time in alignment with organisational strategy
#### Frameworks
one of the most common used is TOGAF - The open group architecture framework
#### TOGAF
is based on 4 interrelated areas of specialization called architecture domains

- **Business architecture** - defines business strategy, governance, organizaition and key business processess of the organization
- **Data architecture** - describes the structure of an organization's logical and physical data assets and the associated daat management resources
- **Application architecture - **provides a blueprint for the individual systems to be deployed, the interactions between the application systems and their relationships to the core business processes of the organization with the frameworks for services to be exposed as business functions for integration
- **Technical architecture** (or technology architecture) - Describe the hardware, software and network infrastructure needed to support the deployment of core, mission-critical applications
#### Benefits of enterprise architecture

- Improved decision-making
- Improved adptability to changing demands or market conditions
- Elimination of inefficient and redundant processes
- Optimisation of the use of organisational resources and capablities
- Support organisation changes for redesigns and reorganization
- facilitates collarboration across the organisation
- facilitates the use of frameworks, methods and approaches as a single source of information
### IT Service Management Frameworks
**ITSM is a strategic approach** to IT management that deliver value to custom/users continuously with increased efficiency and effectiveness ITSM是一种IT管理的战略方法，它以更高的效率和有效性不断向客户/用户交付价值
core concept of ITSM is that:

- An organisation's IT-based outcomes should be delivered continuously
- through a set of policeis, processes tools and skills for both development and operations
- to create value aligned with organisational goals and strategy
- rather than be the result of a development project handed over to a separate domain of operations to be run.
### The agile approach
Agile is an approach to software development that seeks the **continuous delivery of small pieces of working software in rapid iterations to improve flexibility, adaptability and customer satisfaction**
Usually, it **consists of small, cross-functional teams regularly meeting **in person throughout the lifecycle
It is based on a set of four values and twelve principles
It is not perspective 
Agile values are informed by the Manifesto for agile Software Development, which describes the four key characteristics that should be valued above others as:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

## Lecture 4: People and Teams
### What is a Team:
is a group of people wih a full set of complemantory skills requried to complete a task, job, or project
#### How to achieve effective teamwork in the workplace
Here are some effective teamwork practices:

#### 5 steps in project estimation

1. determine the SIZE of project
2. determine the EFFORT of project
3. decide on the RESOURCES needed
4. calculate the DURATION
5. calculate the COST

6 approaches to project estimation

1. Function point analysis - medium scale estimation metric
   1. Classify each component(Inp, Out, Inq, Maf, Inf) as simple, average, or complex
   2. Compute technical complexity factor (TCF)
   3. Number of function points = UFP * TCF
2. Algorithmic cost models - SLIM, PriceS, COCOMO
3. Component matrix
4. Expert judgement
   - Relatively cheap estimation method.
   - Takes relatively little time and effort
   - Can be applied early in the development cycle
   - Can be successful if experts have direct experience of similar systems
   - Rather subjective
   - Depends on experience and judgment
   - Cannot be used if no suitable experts available
   - Assumes experts have dealt with similar systems
   - Assumes they all have reliable data available
5. Sum of the part
Make use of WBS, total effort estimate in the sum of estimates for individual tasks
6. Estimation by analogy
   - Systematic, fairly fast
   - OK if sufficient historical data available
   - Can be applied early in the development cycle
   - Have to determine set of characteristics suitable for classifying systems
   - Requires a database containing systematically maintained historical size cost data.
   - Cannot be used if no comparable projects have ever been tackled, or if no suitable historical data is available
## Lecture 6 Quality Assurance
QA is a **process-centered approach** to ensuring that a company or organization is providing the best possible products or services.
It relates to **Quality Control**, which focus on the result

- QA -> Process to ensure that the quality is achieved
- QC -> Process to identify whether the quality is achieved

**Quality assurance focuses on enhancing and improving the process that is used to create the end result, rather than focusing on the result itself. QA关注的是如何提高的过程，而非结果**
#### How to define and measure 'quality'

- Quality criteria

Specific requirements and expactations that your project stakeholders have for the deliverables and processes of your project. 项目相关者对项目可交付物品及过程的期望
Based on various factors customer needs, industry standards, regulatory compliance, best practices or internal policies 基于用户需求，行业标准等因素

- Quality standard

Quality standards are the benchmarks or guidelines that you use to measure and evaluate the quality of your project deliverables and processes. 用来度量和评估项目可交付成果和过程质量的基准或指导方针。
Quality refers to the likelihood of reaching the stated objectives or desired costs, or both. 达到既定目标或预期成本的可能性，或两者兼而有之。

- Quality metrics

Quality metrics are the quantitative indicators that you use to track and report the quality of your project deliverables and processes 用来跟踪和报告项目可交付成果和过程质量的定量指标
Based on various dimensions such as functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability or security 基于不同的维度，例如功能、可靠性、可用性、效率、可维护性或安全性。
#### Comparison of QA vs. QC
QA: aim to prevent the defect; a technique of managing quality; does not involve executing the program; example: verification; process to create the deliverables; responsible for full software development lifecycle
QC: aim to identify and improve the defects; a method to verify quality; always involve executing program; example: validation; process to veriffy the deliverable; responsible for software testing lifecycle
QA是一个更加全面 面向整个软件开发流程的工作 而QC只参与软件测试

Introduction of GDPR: 2016, EU recognized the need to update its data protection laws, the outdated 1995 Data Protection Directive was replaced with  GDPR
**Key features**: Effective from May 25, 2018, GDPR set new, uniform standards for data protection across EU; aims to enhance privacy rights and address risks associated with data processing
Impact and enforcement: GDPR imposes enforceable requirements on organizations handling personal data; Non-compliance can result in significant penalties, driving organizations to prioritize data protection. 强制企业处理数据安全问题 不合规就罚款
**GDPR Key Aspects**

- Scope and Applicability - applies to all organizations that process personal data of individuals residing in the EU, regardless of the organizations' location 所有 用到欧盟境内居住人员信息的企业
- Consent and Lawful Basis for Processing - organization must obtain clear and explicit consent from individuals before processing their personal data. Must have a lawful basis for processing data. 在搜集/使用个人数据之前要先获得明确许可 必须要有处理数据的合法基础
- Enhanced Rights of Individuals - grants individuals various rights, including the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict and data portability 增强个人权限 用户可以对自己的数据进行简单的处理
- Data Protection by Design and Default - organizations are required to implement data protection measures from outset of any data processing activity(privacy by design) and ensure that only necessary data is processed(privacy by default) 在数据处理开始时就保护数据隐私，只处理必要的数据
- Data Breach Notification - organizations must report data breaches to relecant supervisory authority within 72h. Individuals must be notified without undue delay if breach is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedom. 在数据泄漏发生后的72小时内向有关监管部门报告，如果数据泄漏对个人安全造成威胁也要向用户报告
- Data Protection Officer (DPO) - some organizations are required to appoint a DPO responsible for overseeing GDPR compliance. 对于大企业 和涉及敏感信息的企业，需要成立DPO部门 负责监督是否出现违反GDPR的情况

- Private cloud - It is dedicated entirely for a single organisation. It resides in the organisation’s facilities or hosted and managed by a third‐party provider. 它完全专用于一个组织。它驻留在组织的设施中或由第三方提供商托管和管理。
- Community cloud - Multiple organisations share resources and services based on common requirements. 多个组织基于共同需求共享资源和服务。
- Hybrid cloud - 以上三种的混合
###### Virtualisation
Virtualisation allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical machine by partitioning the resources of the physical machine into multiple virtual environments 虚拟化通过将物理机的资源划分为多个虚拟环境，从而允许多个虚拟机(vm)在单个物理机上运行 
Components: 

- Hypervisor 虚拟层
- Guest OS
- Host OS
- Virtual network
- Virtual Storage

Bare-metal visualization 裸机虚拟化 hypervisor直接安装在本机的硬件上 更好的安全性和性能 但是操作更麻烦
hosted virtualization 托管虚拟化 虚拟机运行在操作系统上 更简单的操作 但是开销更大
Cloud service model

- IaaS - user manage OS,storage, app. Most flexible, hard to use, apply in complex/huge system a
- PaaS - user manage app and data. mid flex, apply in deployment and co-develop
- SaaS - user only manage the app and use.
##### Vulnerability漏洞 已有软件中的缺点。当缺点被恶意攻击者利用时 会造成伤害
##### Backdoors 后门 绕过authorization而进入系统的方法，通常是为了维护而主动添加的
##### Denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) 使得用户无法访问计算机或网络 攻击方式包括反复篡改用户密码 或是通过使系统过载而无法回复用户请求 ddos攻击通过多个ip地址进行攻击 使得防火墙的防护往往无法生效
##### Direct access attack 通过未经认证的访问来进入设施以添加malware。这类攻击也可以传播至别的设备中通过摄像头或储存设备 使其成为恶意软件的载体
##### Eavesdropping窃听，也可以表现为窃取电子邮件信息 对敏感信息进行加密 使用防火墙 vpn等方式防止入侵 培养员工安全意识
##### Spoofing 欺骗 通过伪装，欺骗或篡改来欺骗目标用户或系统的攻击方式。以隐藏攻击者的真实身份
